## Starting With EXPO

Welcome to the Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

### Get started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:
   - [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/).

### Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:
```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
